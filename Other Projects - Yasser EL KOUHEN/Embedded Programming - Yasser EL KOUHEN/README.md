# Robot Project

## Overview
This repository contains all the necessary files for the **Embedded Programming Robot Project** completed as part of the engineering curriculum at Mines Saint-Ã‰tienne.

## Development Environment
This project was developed using **STM32CubeIDE**, leveraging its integrated toolchain for STM32 microcontroller development. The project includes:
- HAL (Hardware Abstraction Layer) drivers
- STM32 peripheral configurations
- Debugging tools available within STM32CubeIDE

## Contents

### 1. **Embedded Programming Report** (`Embedded Programming Report - Yasser EL KOUHEN.pdf`)
- A detailed report on the robot project, including:
  - Project specifications and requirements
  - Design and architecture
  - Implementation details
  - Testing and results
  - Challenges faced and improvements made

### 2. **Project Code (C, C++)** (`Project Code (C,C++ language).pdf`)
- Contains the source code written in C and C++ for the robot's embedded system.
- The code covers:
  - Robot control logic
  - Sensor integration (sonar, servo motors)
  - Motor control using PWM signals
  - UART communication
  - Battery monitoring

## How to Navigate
- **Start by reading the Embedded Programming Report** to understand the project's objectives and methodology.
- **Refer to the Project Code document** for the detailed implementation of the software.
- If implementing or modifying the project, extract the necessary code snippets from the `Project Code` document.
